# Widescreen Phase 2 — design notes

**Status (2026-05-26):** ALL implementation work REVERTED to the
pre-Phase-2 state (commit `d3ff4c374`).  Reverted in-tree
hard-reset; the working code that was committed during attempts
(`564650014` .. `9be970693`) is recoverable from `git reflog` if a
future attempt wants to start from it instead of from scratch.

**This document is kept as the record of what was tried, what
broke, and why** — so the next attempt doesn't re-walk the same
dead ends.  See the "Progress log" at the bottom for the slice
history.

**TL;DR of lessons learned:**

- **Option A (port-side EWRAM shadow buffer + PPU patch)** is the
  cleanest path to BG widescreen.  Avoids TXT512x256 + VRAM-
  collision dead-end.  Got BG reveal working in normal gameplay.
- **Step F (clean black margin in non-game tasks)** required
  fixing `memset(bg_priority, 0xFF, ...)` in mode1.c AND mode2.c
  (was 0 — broke composite force-black check), plus clipping
  mode2's affine BG2 render at `MODE1_GBA_BG_CLIP_X`.
- **Step C-2 (OAM viewport extension)** is the hard one.  Bumping
  `MODE1_GBA_VIEWPORT_X` to `MODE1_GBA_WIDTH` exposes
  engine-parked off-screen sprites past col 240; the engine
  parking convention assumes y=0xA0 disable-bit-set but also
  scatter-positions some active entities at x≥240 that we can't
  easily distinguish from "real" widescreen sprites without
  rewriting the engine's entity culling.
- **Step C-3 (true 16:9 with MODE1_GBA_HEIGHT=180)** was attempted
  the same way — extend the PPU height + keep OAM y threshold
  pinned at 160 — but the engine's main loop fundamentally assumes
  160-line frames for timing and BG preload, so the extra 20
  lines pull in undefined buffer content.
- **TXT512x256 (attempt 1)** doesn't work for TMC: cb2 (VRAM
  blocks 16-23) is referenced by BG1 high-index tile reads via
  `hyruleTownTileSetManager` dest2, so relocating widescreen
  screen bases there destroys chardata.  No free 2-block pair
  exists in TMC's gameplay VRAM layout.

## Current state (Phase 1)

- `MODE1_GBA_WIDTH` overridable at compile time via xmake
  `--widescreen_width=N`. Default 240. Spike value 256.
- `MODE1_GBA_BG_CLIP_X` follows `MODE1_GBA_WIDTH` up to 256, then
  caps at 256.
- Post-render stretch in `port/port_ppu.cpp` only fires for >256;
  at ≤256 the BG renderer fills the wider buffer natively.
- OAM viewport stays at 240 unconditionally — bumping it leaks the
  engine's parked off-screen sprites into the visible widescreen
  area.

## Why >256 doesn't "just work"

The original PPU comment ("real widescreen needs a 64-tile sa2-style
BGCNT_TXT512x256 extension") implies the BG buffers are 32-tile wide
and need to grow. Survey of the actual code shows the situation is
more layered:

### BG buffer layout (`include/vram.h`)

```
gBG0Buffer: u16[0x400]   (32×32 = 1024 entries)
gBG1Buffer: u16[0x400]
gBG2Buffer: u16[0x400]
gBG3Buffer: u16[0x800]   (32×64 = 2048 entries — NOT 64×32)
```

**gBG3 is taller, not wider.** Confirmed by `src/enemy/waterDrop.c:76`
which addresses the bottom half as `(y & 0x1fU) * 0x20 + 0x400`. The
extra 0x400 entries are a vertical pre-load buffer used during
vertical room transitions, not a wider BG.

### Tile rendering pipeline

1. `RenderMapLayerToSubTileMap(gMapDataBottomSpecial, &gMapBottom)`
   in `src/beanstalkSubtask.c:1126` renders the full room layer into
   `gMapDataBottomSpecial` (`u16[0x4000]` = 128KB intermediate).
   Uses **0x80 row stride** = 128 u16 = 64 subtiles wide. This is the
   intermediate's layout, NOT any BG buffer.

2. The "scroll modes" in `src/scroll.c` (`Scroll0`..`Scroll5`) copy a
   32-tile window from `gMapDataTopSpecial` / `gMapDataBottomSpecial`
   into `gBGnBuffer` based on camera position. Each mode handles a
   different room transition pattern (continuous scroll, screen-by-
   screen, vertical-only, fade-in, etc.).

3. DMA pushes `gBGnBuffer` → VRAM at the configured screen-base.

### Hardware-side BG screen-size encoding

- BGCNT bits 14–15: `00` = 256×256 (1 screen block), `01` = 512×256,
  `10` = 256×512, `11` = 512×512.
- TMC sets BG0–3 to `00` at `src/common.c:647`. Title screen at
  `src/title.c:251` already overrides BG2 to `512×256` (`| BGCNT_TXT512x256`),
  proving the PPU + hardware path handles it.
- 512×256 mode requires 2 screen blocks in VRAM (left + right). The
  EWRAM-side buffer needs to mirror this: u16[0x800] with the right
  block at offset 0x400.

## The actual work for Phase 2

### Step A: BG buffer horizontal expansion

For each BG layer that should be widescreen (BG1, BG2, BG3 — leave
BG0 as 32-tile so UI offsets stay stable):

1. Grow `gBGnBuffer` from `u16[0x400]` to `u16[0x800]` in
   `include/vram.h`. For gBG3, expand from 32×64 to a layout that
   covers both horizontal (64) and vertical (64) — i.e.
   `u16[0x1000]`. (Or accept losing the vertical pre-load buffer in
   exchange for horizontal — needs to be evaluated.)
2. Update every `MemClear`/`MemCopy` `sizeof(gBGnBuffer)` / hardcoded
   `0x800` to track the new size. ~30 sites already mapped:
   - `src/debug.c:29-30`
   - `src/cutscene.c:263`
   - `src/gameUtils.c:972-975`
   - `src/common.c:628`
   - `src/menu/figurineMenu.c:121-122,577-578,648-650`
   - `src/staffroll.c:117,134,201-203`
   - `src/subtask.c:109`
   - `src/demo.c:69-70`
   - `src/ui.c:181`
   - `src/fileselect.c:398,410-411,800`
3. Update BGCNT init at `src/common.c:647-653` to OR in
   `BGCNT_TXT512x256` for each widened layer.

### Step B: Scroll-mode widening

Each scroll mode currently copies a 32-tile window. Update to copy
64 tiles, with the right half going to gBGnBuffer offset 0x400:

- `Scroll0` (most common — single-screen rooms with camera tracking)
- `Scroll1` (cont'd scroll between rooms)
- `Scroll2` (transition with fade)
- `Scroll4` (vertical scroll)
- `Scroll5` (special — boss rooms?)

Each `ScrollNSubM` variant also needs updating. The 0x80 stride in
the intermediates already covers 64 tiles, so the SOURCE side is fine
— it's the destination-write loop that needs widening.

### Step C: OAM viewport extension

`MODE1_GBA_VIEWPORT_X` in `libs/ViruaPPU/include/cpu/mode1.h` must
track `MODE1_GBA_WIDTH` so sprites in the widescreen area render.
Catch: the engine "parks" off-screen sprites by setting their OAM x
to 240+. Bumping the viewport without changing the engine's parking
position makes those parked sprites visible.

Either:
- Patch the engine's "park sprite" code to use a position past the
  widescreen viewport (e.g. `MODE1_GBA_WIDTH + 16`)
- Add a port-side OAM filter that hides sprites flagged as
  off-screen-parked
- Detect parked sprites by a sentinel attribute and clip them in the
  PPU

### Step D: UI offset audit

`src/ui.c`, `src/message.c`, `src/fileselect.c` use ~30 hardcoded
offsets like `&gBG0Buffer[0x219]`. If BG0 stays at 32-tile width,
none of these need to change. If BG0 widens too (to support widescreen
HUDs), every offset needs to be re-derived for the new stride.

**Recommendation**: keep BG0 at 32-tile, widen only BG1/BG2/BG3.

### Step E: Camera bounds

`UpdateCamera` / equivalent currently limits camera scroll so the
32-tile window stays inside the room. With a 64-tile window, the
limit changes. The room can also become too small for the wider
view — needs runtime check + fallback (centre the room with bars).

### Step F: Cutscene / dialogue blackout

Cutscenes often draw text/effects assuming a 240-wide playfield.
Either let the wider area show through (game world visible behind
cutscene text) or render black side-bars during cutscenes.

## Verification approach

Each step needs visual verification before moving to the next.
Recommend the loop:

1. Make a single isolated change.
2. Build with `xmake build -y tmc_pc`.
3. Run `./build/pc/tmc_pc` and visit a representative area:
   - Hyrule Town (BG2 + BG1 dense)
   - Minish Woods (BG3 dense forest)
   - Temple of Droplets (BG3 dynamic water effects)
   - File select (BG0 UI-heavy)
   - Title screen (already uses BG2 512×256)
4. F9 bug-report capture for any regression.
5. If clean, commit; otherwise revert and try a different approach.

## Scope estimate

- Step A: 1–2 sessions of mechanical edits + memcpy audit
- Step B: 2–3 sessions per scroll mode (5 modes + sub-variants)
- Step C: 1 session
- Step D: 0 sessions if BG0 stays 32-tile
- Step E: 1 session
- Step F: 1 session

Total: ~10–15 focused sessions of engineering + verification.

## Progress log

### ✅ Slice 1 — `564650014`: ViruaPPU per-BG render-width clipping

`port/patches/viruappu-widescreen.patch` extended to:
- `render_text_bg_line` honours BGCNT bit 14: 32-tile BGs clip at
  `MODE1_GBA_BG_CLIP_X` (240); 64-tile BGs (TXT512x256) render up
  to `MODE1_GBA_WIDTH`.
- Composite force-black past col 240 is now conditional on "no BG
  drew here" so widescreen BG content passes through.

### ✅ Slice 2 — `25e0ae997`: BG right-half buffers + this doc

`gBG0BufferRight` / `gBG1BufferRight` / `gBG2BufferRight` declared at
`gEwram[0x36000..0x37800]` (otherwise-unused EWRAM tail).  Each is a
`u16[0x400]` (32×32 tilemap) for cols 32..63 of a TXT512x256 BG.

Two-buffer layout chosen over extending gBG[012]Buffer in-place
because `gBG0Buffer` at `0x34CB0` and `gBG2Buffer` at `0x344B0` are
EWRAM-adjacent — a naive `0x400 → 0x800` bump would overlap either
adjacent buffer or `gMapBottom`.

### ✅ Slice 3 — `e3778b4e6`: `sub_08016CA8` DMA wiring

The per-VBlank DMA routine now takes a `void* right_half` argument
(PC_PORT only).  When `BGCNT size_flag == 1` (TXT512x256), it issues
a second 0x800-byte DMA from `right_half` to VRAM base+0x800.
Callers in `src/interrupts.c::UpdateDisplayControls` and
`src/gameUtils.c::RestoreGameTask` pass the appropriate
`gBG[012]BufferRight` (or NULL for BG3).

### ❌ Step B-2 attempt 2 — VRAM dead-end (reverted)

**Approach tried**: keep the engine's per-scroll-mode routines
unchanged.  After every `UpdateScrollVram`, run port-side
`Port_PopulateBG_TXT512x256` that fully repopulates both halves
from the intermediate with mod-64 alignment + OR's BGCNT bit 14
(TXT512x256) + relocates the screen base to a "free" pair of
blocks so the right-half DMA (`base + 0x800`) doesn't collide with
another BG's screen base.

**Why it failed**: in Hyrule Town,
`src/manager/hyruleTownTileSetManager.c` loads tileset chardata
to `BG_SCREEN_ADDR(16/18/20)` (blocks 16-21, in the cb2 region),
each load 0x1000 bytes (= 2 blocks).  These chardata blocks ARE
referenced by BG1: BG1 cb1 = blocks 8-15, but BG1 tile indices in
the room can reach `0x200+` whose pixel data sits at `cb1_base +
0x200 * 32 = 0x4000 + 0x4000 = 0x8000` = block 16 = cb2 region.
So even though no BG sets its BGCNT.charbase to 2, BG1 indirectly
USES cb2 for high-index tile chardata.

Relocating BG1+BG2 screen bases into blocks 16-19 (the only
"free" pair we could find) writes screen tilemap entries on top
of this chardata.  Result: BG1 then renders my screen tilemap
entries as if they were tile pixel data → whole-screen corruption.
Bug report `bugreport_20260525_212401` is the canonical capture.

**Searched but no truly-free 2-block pair exists in TMC's gameplay
VRAM layout**:
- Blocks 0-7: cb0 (BG2/BG3) — actively loaded with tilesets.
- Blocks 8-15: cb1 (BG1) — actively loaded.
- Blocks 16-23: cb2 — loaded by HTTSM dest2 + indirectly used by
  BG1 tile indices ≥ 0x200.
- Blocks 24-27: cb3 (BG0) — BG0 chardata (tiles < 0x100 only,
  so blocks 28-31 are screen bases inside the same cb region).
- Blocks 28-31: BG0/1/2/3 screen tilemaps.

The standard 4-BG layout fills 64 KB of BG VRAM tightly; there's
no slack to insert a second screen block for a widened BG.

**Reverted commit**: `0f0c68556` (rolled back in [this commit]).
What we kept:
- `xmake.lua` `widescreen_width` option still wired to emit
  `-DMODE1_GBA_WIDTH=N` for the tmc_pc target — useful for future
  attempts.
- `port_ppu.cpp` Phase-1 uniform-stretch fallback is back in
  place — so a build at `--widescreen_width=320` again shows a
  stretched 240-px frame (no visual regression vs main).

### ✅ Step B-2 — Option A landed (port-side shadow buffer)

Implementation:

1. `libs/ViruaPPU/include/cpu/mode1.h`: declare
   `virtuappu_mode1_ws_shadow[MODE1_GBA_BG_COUNT]` (per-BG u16 tile-
   entry table) + `virtuappu_mode1_ws_shadow_base_tile[]`
   (per-BG "where in PPU tile_col space does shadow[i=0] live?").
   Define `MODE1_WS_SHADOW_COLS = 12` (covers 320 wide + scroll
   headroom) and `MODE1_WS_SHADOW_ROWS = 32` (mirrors mod-32 row
   rolling).

2. `libs/ViruaPPU/src/mode1.c::render_text_bg_line`: when a 32-tile
   BG has a non-NULL shadow registered, render up to
   `MODE1_GBA_WIDTH` instead of clipping at `MODE1_GBA_BG_CLIP_X`.
   For `x >= MODE1_GBA_BG_CLIP_X` it reads `tile_entry.raw` from
   `shadow[local_row * 12 + shadow_idx]` instead of VRAM.
   `shadow_idx = (tile_col - shadow_base + 32) % 32` handles
   BGHOFS-wrap so sub-tile scroll past a mod-32 boundary still
   indexes the right cell.  Chardata lookup + palette + flip are
   unchanged.

3. `port/port_linked_stubs.c::Port_Widescreen_UpdateShadows`:
   per-frame populate (called from `UpdateDisplayControls`).  Reads
   23 BG-tile rows × 12 cols from `gMapData{Bottom,Top}Special` at
   world cols `[cam_bg_col + 30, cam_bg_col + 30 + 12)`, writes to
   `sWsShadowBG[12]`.  Sets the PPU's pointer + base_tile globals.
   `#if MODE1_GBA_WIDTH > 240` gated, no-op at native 240.

4. `port/port_ppu.cpp`: removed the Phase-1 uniform-stretch fallback
   (was clobbering real Phase-2 BG content with stretched 240-px).

VRAM is untouched — the shadow lives entirely in port-side EWRAM.
Cost: 1.5 KB of statics + ~700 u16 writes per frame.  Trivial.

Known follow-ups:
- File-select / cutscenes / menus repurpose `gMapData{T,B}Special`
  for HUD content; my shadow reads that as if it were world tiles
  and shows HUD-tile bleed past col 240.  Step F should detect
  these modes and either disable shadow or render black bars.
- Rooms narrower than (visible cols + widescreen reveal) show
  tile-0 → composite force-black past room width.  Step E should
  bound camera scroll so the reveal area stays inside the room,
  or render side bars when it can't.
- OAM still clips at `MODE1_GBA_VIEWPORT_X = 240` (step C-2).
  Sprites stop at the native viewport edge.

### Reference: alternative approaches not taken

**Option B (VRAM reorganization)** — move BG0's chardata to a
tighter region to free blocks 28-31 for widened-BG screen bases.
Many touch-points (every `gScreen.bg0.control` writer), high risk
of breaking non-gameplay modes.  Skipped in favour of Option A.

**Option C (Phase-1 stretch)** — uniform 240→320 stretch.  Was the
fallback before Option A landed.  No longer applicable.

### 🔲 Step C-2 — OAM viewport extension

Currently OAM clips at `MODE1_GBA_VIEWPORT_X = 240` (parked off-screen
sprites live there).  For widescreen, either bump the OAM clip with
the BG width OR move the engine's "park" position past the new
viewport.

### 🔲 Step C-3 — mode-transition robustness

`Port_PopulateBG_TXT512x256` only re-asserts BGCNT bit 14 when
`UpdateScrollVram` fires.  Engine code that overwrites
`gScreen.bg[12].control` on mode transitions (cutscenes, menus,
file-select — see the bg-control grep in the commit message)
clears the bit until the next gUpdateVisibleTiles.  In the gap
window the right half stays in VRAM with its last content but
isn't read by the PPU (32x32 mode), so the user sees the BG
shrink back to 240-wide momentarily.  Fix: re-assert the bit in
`UpdateDisplayControls` instead of (or in addition to)
`Port_PopulateBG_TXT512x256` so it survives every frame regardless
of scroll-update timing.

### 🔲 Steps D / E / F — UI offsets, camera bounds, cutscene bars

Per the original design above.

### 2026-05-30 re-attempt (reverted again) — new finding: room-transition scroll distance

Re-did Option A from scratch — direct `gMapData{Bottom,Top}Special` reads in
`render_text_bg_line` for `x >= MODE1_GBA_BG_CLIP_X` (no separate shadow buffer),
camera centering + right-clamp keyed to the view width (`src/scroll.c`), sprite
visibility widened (`CheckOnScreen` / `CheckRectOnScreen` / `RenderSpritePieces`),
non-gameplay **stretch** in `port_ppu.cpp`, OAM viewport = `MODE1_GBA_WIDTH`.
Verified at 384: gameplay BG fills the full width, seamless at the col-240 split,
camera centered. All reverted to the documented baseline (option present, unwired).

Re-confirmed the **Step C-2 dead-end**: OAM/entity flicker is the blocker. Widescreen
reveals cols 240..W where the engine parks/animates sprites it treats as off-screen,
and `CheckOnScreen`-gated AI runs there too → occasional 1-frame sprite flash near the
edges. No clean global fix; it is per-entity (several enemies/objects use hardcoded
`scroll_x + 0x108`-style bounds, e.g. gyorgChild/gyorgMale/bombPeahat).

**NEW finding (not previously documented): overworld room transitions hardcode a 240px
scroll distance.** `src/scroll.c::Scroll2Sub2` scrolls horizontal room crossings until
`unk_18 == 0x3c` (60 steps × 4px = 240 = native width). With a wider camera the
destination camera position is one *view* width away, so the transition under-scrolls by
`W-240` and leaves a **permanent black band** on the leading edge after entry
(reproduced walking into Lon Lon Ranch, area 0x03 room 0x05). Working fix: gate the
horizontal cases on `viewwidth/4` (= 96 at 384) instead of `0x3c`; vertical stays `0x28`
(height unchanged). Caveat: the leading edge still goes black *during* the ~1.5s scroll,
because the wide view spans the room being left while `gMapData*Special` is already the
destination room (clips to backdrop). Seamless transitions need both rooms' maps live
during the cross-fade.

Also: non-gameplay screens (title via the GBA-mode-1 → ViruaPPU-mode-2 path, menus, boot
logos) want a 240→W **stretch** (fills the screen, no bars). Pillarbox bars were
explicitly rejected during review.
